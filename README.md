# TrackCurvature
Quick test of SuperNEMO track shapes - it's a small SensitivityModule-like module that outputs a few variables for looking at the radius of curvature of tracks. plotCurvatures.C is an example script for analysing the output. It expects an input of some files (made from this module, and names hard-coded) that aren't attached, so it won't run by default.
